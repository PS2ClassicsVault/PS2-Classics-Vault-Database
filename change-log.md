This release comes with new fixes and changes to the stable channel of the PS2CV Store

**Changelog:**

- Fixed an issue when users remote play on a PSP system it would try to increase the resolution above 480p, this issue has been resolved.
New arcade like music (we don't want to get sued by Nintendo for copyrighted music)
Fixed an issue when users hover over the app the music would be really loud, we fixed this by decreasing the volume of the music by 50%.
Improved network code and user end connectivity that was fixed in the BETA version of the store.
In-App music is now enabled by default (this can be turned off in the applications settings).
NOTICE:

- Users under v1.34 of this application will not receive this update via the app, they must update manually.
