DOWNLOADS LICENSE AGREEMENT:

1).  You hereby agree that all links, files or anything we offer digitally is not to be shared even if the links to a specific download such as a game and app is not directly shared through our Patreon.

If you're caught sharing our links/downloads your membership will be revoked and you will be banned from the r/ps2classicsvault sub reddit for 12 months.



FAILURE TO COMPLY AGREEMENT:

1). You hereby agree that if users fail to comply with this agreement, the current links will be deactivated and updated with new links to restrict access once again. You agree that all members are treated equally. Therefore, if one person violates the terms of this agreement, it may affect the amount each user pays per month. This translates to a "loss of revenue fee" equaling approximately $5.00 USD. This decision is not taken lightly and affects every user.

The task of keeping these servers running takes hard work, and in order to keep these services available, there is a cost. By violating these terms, it makes it possible for these services to be shut down. This project is funded by the community, and in order to be enjoyed by all, it is important that this agreement be followed.

WHY DID WE MAKE THIS CHANGE?

These changes were made as it has been discovered that one user has been sharing links. This may not seem like it is that important, but in order to keep these services going, if one were to want access, they would need to pay. It was known that this might happen, but we as a service were hopeful that the honor of users would keep them from sharing links.

All money received is used to pay for server bills and to increase capacity so that more game titles can be added to this service. If many people use this service without payment, it doesn't allow for improvements to be made.

In order to keep this project going, we must be mindful of link sharing. If there is enough interest, we may allow a multi-user option, but currently it does not seem to be necessary.
